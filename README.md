## Run Locally

The portfolio's static sections work by opening `index.html` in a browser. To test the chatbot locally, run the project using Vercel's development environment so the `/api/chat` function is available.

1. Install Node.js and the Vercel CLI.
2. In the project directory, run `vercel dev`.
3. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to your local Vercel environment (do not place it in `config.js`).
4. Open the local URL provided by Vercel.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push the updated project files to the portfolio repository.
2. Import or redeploy the repository in Vercel.
3. In Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables, add `GROQ_API_KEY` with a newly generated Groq API key.
4. Optionally set `GROQ_MODEL` if the Groq model name needs to be changed.
5. Redeploy and test project search, theme toggle, weather, mobile layout, all project links, and chatbot responses.

## Security

Never commit an API key to `config.js`, `script.js`, or any other public frontend file. The chatbot function reads the key from the server-side `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable. If a key has already been published or pasted into shared content, revoke it and create a new one.
